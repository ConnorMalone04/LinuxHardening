## AppArmor
AppArmor is Mandatory Access Control (MAC) like security system for
Linux. AppArmor confines individual programs to a set of files,
capabilities, network access and rlimits, collectively known as
the AppArmor policy for the program, or simply as a profile.
AppArmor provides profiles for many common services, but it is
very easy to create new ones.
